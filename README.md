# Introduction

This is a quick start to deploy an SMB server in Azure using cost-optimised CVO virtual services.

This is much more efficient than running your own SMB servers and offers the following benefits:

1. **Cost-optimisation by default** - fit more of your data into what you buy from Azure. Most folks get at least a 3:1 saving. What does that mean? Well, for every 3GB of data, you only consume 1GB of space in Azure!
2. **Powerful migration capabilities** - Sure, you can use RoboCopy, RSYNC and the usual suspects, but you can also use powerful block level replication which is not only faster, but also costs MUCH less over time vs file-based replication technolgies
3. **Trusted** - CVO is trusted by tonnes of companies worldwide, from the biggest to smallest deployments, it's suitable for all.
4. **Secure** - not only is it secure out of the box, but there is no OS patching, etc for you - it's all taken care of automatically and trusted by the biggest banks and military institutions in the world.
5. **Simplicity** - That's why you're here - lets get started by using Terraform workspaces and GitHub actions to automatically deploy your new service.
